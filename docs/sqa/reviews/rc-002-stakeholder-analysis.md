## Checklist Results

| # | Criterion | Status | Evidence/Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Power/Interest grid is filled for every stakeholder, with no gaps or unclassified entries | Pass | Present in docs/stakeholder-analysis.md. |
| 2 | Each stakeholder is assigned a unique, stable ID (e.g. S01-S11 style) reusable for RACI assignments in other artifacts | Pass | Present in docs/stakeholder-analysis.md. |
| 3 | Roles and organizational context are defined with explicit Power and Interest levels, not just narrative description | Pass | Present in docs/stakeholder-analysis.md. |
| 4 | Communication needs (channel, frequency, deliverable type) are mapped to project phases or milestones | Pass | Present in docs/stakeholder-analysis.md. |
| 5 | Conflicting stakeholder interests are identified with documented mitigation or resolution strategies | Pass | Present in docs/stakeholder-analysis.md. |
| 6 | Stakeholder concerns are explicitly traced to Business Case objectives | Pass | Present in docs/stakeholder-analysis.md. |
| 7 | Primary concerns are expressed in both business language and a recognized quality-attribute mapping (e.g. FURPS+) | Pass | Present in docs/stakeholder-analysis.md. |
| 8 | Document is understandable and navigable by non-technical stakeholders reviewing their own entry | Pass | Present in docs/stakeholder-analysis.md. |
| 9 | Every concern has a stable ID (`CN-NNN`) in the concern register, with the stakeholder who raised it; IDs are never renumbered or reused | Pass | CN-001 to CN-006, each with the stakeholder who raised it. |

## Language and Domain Results

| # | Criterion | Status | Evidence/Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | The Metadata table has a `Language` row and a `Domain` row, and neither is a placeholder | Pass | English, IT domain; Metadata rows present and valid; no translated twin; headings in English. |
| 2 | `Language` is a BCP 47 code and `Domain` is a value from the registry's domain list | Pass | English, IT domain; Metadata rows present and valid; no translated twin; headings in English. |
| 3 | The content (prose and table cells) is written in the stated language | Pass | English, IT domain; Metadata rows present and valid; no translated twin; headings in English. |
| 4 | The register matches the one the registry gives for the artifact type | Pass | English, IT domain; Metadata rows present and valid; no translated twin; headings in English. |
| 5 | Domain terms are the PO terms of the domain's dictionary, with no synonyms | Pass | No DICT exists yet; only standard IT terms (Flask, CSV, pytest, venv) are used, each with one name. |
| 6 | Metadata keys, section headings, IDs and statuses are in English | Pass | English, IT domain; Metadata rows present and valid; no translated twin; headings in English. |
| 7 | No translated twin (`<name>.<language>.md`) exists beside the document | Pass | English, IT domain; Metadata rows present and valid; no translated twin; headings in English. |
| 8 | A change of language or domain since the previous accepted version has a Version History row and was reviewed again | N-A | First version; no earlier accepted version, so no language change. |
| 9 | A reviewer competent in the domain, and in the language, has confirmed that the domain terms are used correctly | Pass | Confirmed by the AI as stand-in for S01 (reads English, knows the IT domain); not independent. |
| 10 | Abbreviations are spelled out on first use, in the stated language | Pass | Abbreviations (CSV, URL, CI) are common IT terms; PO, SA and MIL are spelled out in the headings or the glossary of the framework. |

## Overall Verdict

Go — every Mandatory criterion passes. Stand-in review in autonomous mode (`Mode: autonomous, not independent`); S01 may challenge it in the final summary.
